                <h2>Basic Cat Care Tips</h2>
                <p>Taking care of a cat requires understanding their basic needs for nutrition, grooming, mental stimulation, and affection. Below are some essential tips for keeping your feline companion healthy and happy.</p>
                
                <h3>1. Nutrition</h3>
                <p>Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning their diet must consist mostly of meat. Feed them high-quality cat food that provides balanced nutrition. Make sure fresh water is always available.</p>
    
                <h4>Key Tips:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feed age-appropriate food (kitten, adult, senior).</li>
                    <li>Avoid feeding them too many treats.</li>
                    <li>Consult your vet about special dietary needs.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>2. Grooming</h3>
                <p>Regular grooming helps keep your cat's coat shiny and prevents matting. Long-haired cats require more frequent grooming than short-haired breeds.</p>
    
                <h4>Key Tips:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brush your cat at least once a week.</li>
                    <li>Trim their nails regularly to prevent overgrowth.</li>
                    <li>Check and clean their ears and teeth regularly.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>3. Veterinary Care</h3>
                <p>Cats need routine check-ups, vaccinations, and preventive care to maintain good health. Regular vet visits can help detect issues early.</p>
    
                <h4>Key Tips:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Schedule annual veterinary visits.</li>
                    <li>Keep vaccinations and flea/tick prevention up to date.</li>
                    <li>Spay/neuter your cat to prevent unwanted litters.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>4. Mental Stimulation & Play</h3>
                <p>Cats need mental stimulation to stay happy and prevent boredom. Provide them with toys, scratching posts, and interactive play sessions.</p>
    
                <h4>Key Tips:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offer a variety of toys to keep them entertained.</li>
                    <li>Provide scratching posts or pads to help them stretch and keep their claws healthy.</li>
                    <li>Spend time playing with your cat to strengthen your bond.</li>
                </ul>
